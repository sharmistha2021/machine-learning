The accurate prediction of stock trends in Bangladesh presents unique challenges due to the lack of tailored advanced models capable of capturing the countryâ€™s economic intricacies. This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model, the Multivariate Hybrid Attention-based BiLSTM with 1D Convolution (MHA-BiLSTM-CNN), specifically designed to address these challenges. The proposed model integrates Bidirectional LSTM layers to capture long-term and short term dependencies, an attention mechanism to focus on critical temporal features, and a 1D convolutional layer to efficiently extract local patterns within the data. The MHA-BiLSTM-CNN model is evaluated against four other advanced models: Attention-based BiLSTM, Attention-based GRU, Attention-based BiGRU, and Attention-based CNN. Through comparative analysis, the MHA-BiLSTM-CNN achieves the highest predictive accuracy of 94.32\%, outperforming the competing models. This hybrid approach significantly advances stock market forecasting, offering valuable insights for financial analysis and facilitating data driven decision making in Bangladesh's financial markets.
